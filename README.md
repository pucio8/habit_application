## üöÄ How to Use

You can run the application locally (see **Installation and Setup**) or deploy it online using **Render**.

### Deploy on Render

1. Push your code to GitHub, making sure it includes:
   * `requirements.txt`
   * `Procfile` (for Gunicorn)
   * `.env` variables (add them later in Render dashboard)

2. Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/) ‚Üí **New Web Service**.

3. Connect your GitHub repository.

4. In the **Build Command**, set:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt && python manage.py migrate
   ```
5. In the Start Command, set:
    ```bash
    gunicorn habit_application.wsgi:application
    ```

Add your environment variables (e.g. SECRET_KEY, DEBUG, DB_NAME, etc.) in the Render dashboard.

Render will assign you a public URL (e.g. https://your-app.onrender.com).

üëâ Now your Habit Application is live and accessible from anywhere!
